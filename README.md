# technicaltest
Implementation of code for a technical test.  

The task: Create a simple application, preferably in Kotlin, that fetches X topmost contributors (e.g. 25) for popular GitHub repository (e.g. ruby or whatever you choose) using GitHub APIs.  

When I started the application, the top repo on github's "trending repos" list was "https://github.com/cli/cli/" so I've used that as the target repo.  

Libraries used:

retrofit/OkHttp

GSON

Glide

JUnit/Robolectric
